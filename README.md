# Curriculum Viewer

This project implements a curriculum viewer using HTML and Javascript. The "alunos.xml" file contains a data collection of courses taken by a set of students. When the student GRR is typed into the table, the data for this particular student is loaded and the table is colored according to the status of each course. For example, if it is green, the student has taken the course and was approved. Left-clicking a cell in the table reveals more details about the last time he took the course. Right-clicking it reveals the history of all the times he took the course.
